# This is a project being done by three random Orem High School students to make a really quite cool (but possibly generic) fantasy choose your own adventure rpg


# ATTENTION: If you can, make your own branch to work on. Next time we meet, we'll compare the changes between us and merge them with the master branch then. This is just so that the master branch won't be cluttered/abused.
